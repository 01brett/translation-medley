# Bible Translation Medley

This app retrieves Bible passages and enables dynamic swapping of individual verses. Each swap is a different translation than the original and is placed in the flow of the original passage. The new, swapped passage is now a medley of various translations providing a unique reading experience and potential new insights on the text. The front-end is built with React, Redux. The backend is built on Node.js with Express.js for API routing and querying different Bible APIs.
